2. Make sure Python 3.8 or Python 3.9 is installed

If you are using Windows or Mac you can acquire python 3.8 through the following link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
If you are using Linux, python 3.8 may already be installed, but if it is not use the following commands in your preferred bash terminal:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8


python3.9 can be installed similarly.

This project has NO dependencies on any sort of non-standard python package! 
It only uses “os” and “typing”, so this is a total plug and play program, 
have fun learning how to become a card shark!

does as little as possible and keeps things organized
